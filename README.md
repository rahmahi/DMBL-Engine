### Project Objectives:
- Employ STIRAP pulses to achieve precise control over localization and thermal phases.
- Develop a quantum engine that operates between dynamically localized and thermal phases using STIRAP pulses.
- Assess the engine's efficiency and benchmark its performance against Halpern's 2019 MBL engine.
